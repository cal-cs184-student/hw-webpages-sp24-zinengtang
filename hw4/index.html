         <p>Changing the spring constant ks has a significant impact on the cloth's behavior. A low ks results in a cloth that appears very unstable and shakes more, while a high ks makes the cloth more stable and less prone to drastic deformations.</p>

    <p>Modifying the density of the cloth affects its weight and how it drapes. A lower density leads to a cloth that appears ligher and exhibits less pronounced curves, especially at the top where it is pinned.</p>
        <p>The damping parameter controls how quickly the cloth comes to rest after being disturbed. Lower damping allows the cloth to swing more freely, while higher damping results in the cloth moving more sluggishly and coming to rest more quickly.</p>

            <div class="caption">Phase 3: Resting state with soft folds.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> With a lower density, the cloth seems to fall more slowly and delicately. It doesn't collapse as heavily onto itself, leading to a less pronounced folding effect. The folds that do form are more gentle and the cloth appears to flutter as it settles.</p>

    <h3>Higher Density (150 g/cm²)</h3>
    <div class="figures-row">
        <div class="figure">

            <div class="caption">Phase 3: Cloth conforming to the ground, lying flat due to weight.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p> The cloth moves with more weight, causing it to fall faster and impact itself with more force, leading to more compressed and tighter folds. The higher mass results in more momentum, making the cloth less responsive to forces that counteract gravity, such as the spring forces within the cloth itself or air resistance. As it comes to rest, the higher density cloth exhibits a more flattened appearance due to the increased weight pressing down.</p>

        </div>
    </div>


    <p> The cloth behaves much more like a liquid or very soft material, draping significantly and showing very little resistance to bending and folding. It sags quickly upon itself with very pronounced and deep folds due to the minimal resistance to deformation. In the rest state, the cloth almost flattens out, conforming closely to the ground as the springs do not provide sufficient force to support the cloth's structure.

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>A higher spring constant results in a cloth that is much more resistant to bending and stretching. This causes the cloth to maintain more of its shape as it falls, leading to sharper and more pronounced folds. </p>

    <h2>Part 5: Cloth Sim</h2>
    <p>A <strong>shader program</strong> is a set of computer graphics instructions that dictate how to render each pixel. It's comprised of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Vertex Shader:</strong> Transforms 3D vertex data to 2D and prepares vertex-related attributes for the next stage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fragment Shader:</strong> Determines the final color and texture of each pixel by using data passed from the vertex shader, performing complex calculations to simulate lighting and material effects.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, these shaders work in tandem to craft the visual details of objects within a 3D scene, rendering realistic or stylized surface effects based on light and material interactions.</p>

    <h3>Blinn-Phong Shading Model Components</h3>
    <p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is a commonly used algorithm in 3D graphics for calculating the color of each pixel based on the lighting, view direction, and material properties. It consists of three main components:

Ambient: This is a basic color applied to every pixel to simulate indirect light in the environment. It doesn't depend on light direction or viewer perspective.
Diffuse: This component simulates direct light absorbed and reflected uniformly by the surface. It depends on the angle between the light source and the surface normal.
Specular: This component models the bright highlight that is seen when a light source reflects off a shiny surface. It depends on the surface's shininess and the angle between the viewer and the reflection direction.

    <h3>Custom Texture Mapping on Cloth Simulation</h3>
    <p>Below is the screenshot of the cloth simulation using a custom texture, which has been applied to give the cloth a unique appearance.</p>

<h3>Bump Mapping vs Displacement Mapping</h3>
    <div class="figures-row">
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="assets/bump_cloth.png" alt="Bump Mapping on Cloth">
            <div class="caption">Bump Mapping on Cloth</div>

            <div class="caption">Displacement Mapping on Sphere</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Bump mapping simulates texture details without altering the mesh's geometry, which is evident from the cloth and sphere images. This gives an illusion of depth but no actual modification to the object's contour. Displacement mapping, on the other hand, physically alters the geometry, creating realistic ridges and bumps on the sphere's surface.</p>
    
    <h3>Mesh Coarseness Reaction</h3>

            <div class="caption">Displacement Mapping with Coarseness -o 128 -a 128</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>With bump mapping, changes in mesh coarseness are less impactful, as the technique doesn't change the mesh's topology. Finer meshes result in smoother perceived texture. Displacement mapping shows more pronounced changes with mesh coarseness; a finer mesh enables more detailed and accurate displacement, creating a more realistic effect.</p>


	<h3>Mirror Shader on Cloth and Sphere</h3>
    <div class="figures-row">
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="assets/mirror_cloth.png" alt="Mirror Shader on Cloth">

            <div class="caption">Mirror Shader on Sphere</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The mirror shader creates a reflective surface that can simulate materials like metal or water by reflecting the environment. The effect on the sphere creates a perfect mirror-like appearance, while on the cloth, the reflections follow the folds and creases, highlighting the simulation's dynamic geometry.</p>
